# SER 335 - Secure Coding Labs

This repository contains secure software development activities completed as part of the **SER 335: Secure Coding** course at **Arizona State University** (Spring 2025).

## 📚 Course Overview

SER 335 focused on secure programming techniques, emphasizing secure software design, input validation, authentication, access control, encryption, static analysis, and vulnerability testing using modern tools.

## 🔐 Topics Covered

- SEI CERT Secure Coding Standards
- Java Security Practices
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Authentication using Salted Hashes
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Static Analysis with SpotBugs + FindSecurityBugs
- Defensive Programming & Exception Handling
- Penetration Testing using Kali Linux & Metasploit
- SQL Injection, XSS, and Mitigations

## 🧪 Activities

| # | Title | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | RBAC + Password Hashing | Implemented RBAC, secure password storage using SHA-256 + salts |
| 2 | Change Password | Secure password update flow with role-based access control |
| 3 | Static Analysis | Identified and fixed code smells using SpotBugs and SEI CERT |
| 4 | Penetration Testing | SQL Injection and brute-force DB attack on BadStore VM |
| 5 | Secure Code Review | Reviewed and refactored insecure Java code using SEI CERT |
| 6 | Secure DevOps | Integrated security controls into Git workflows (planned) |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java 18
- Eclipse, IntelliJ IDE
- SpotBugs + FindSecurityBugs
- Kali Linux (Metasploit, sqlmap, Wireshark)
- Docker (BadStore VM)
- Git, GitHub

## 🧠 Key Skills Gained

- Implemented salted password authentication and RBAC securely
- Conducted secure code reviews using SEI CERT standards
- Used SpotBugs/FindSecurityBugs to detect vulnerabilities in Java code
- Executed SQL Injection and brute-force attacks in a safe lab environment
- Applied defensive programming and exception handling practices
